## Personal Website

This page is meant to show who I am: a Computer Science graduate, who is passionate about front-end, back-end and everything in between. It's not perfect yet, but I'm proud of what it's become so far.

Currently the website shows the projects which I'm most proud of, the skillset I've gained, a way to contact me, and also the ability to see my newest CV, which you can also download through Google Drive.

Extra additions will be made soon, as I'm planning to make the layout even more intuitive and to add a more personal touchâ€”so stay tuned!

Made with React+Typescript.
